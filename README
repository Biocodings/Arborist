Code for version 0 has been tested on multicore implementations for the R front end.
Latest changes are geared toward hierarchical parallelization:  distributed over heterogeneous.  Low-level support to be available before actual interfaces are provided.
Several performance issues have been resolved, but multicore load-balancing will likely not get much attention until version 2.
Correctness errors are being addressed as they are received.
Version 1 does not go to CRAN until examples improved and vignettes provided.
