Arborist
========

Modular, extensible implementation of the Random Forest (TM) algorithm.

Directory structure:

  BridgeR contains Rcpp/RcppArmadillo definitions and call-backs.
  Arborist contains the core implementation.
  
The source code is currently in a transitional state, reflecting the merger of two internal versions, and will neither execute nor build.
